# Simple rust example

This is a rust version of an F# covered in BuildStuffLT 2015.

Once you have rust 1.4 installed, you can run it as:

```
$ cargo run --release --quiet ../day1/digits/trainingsample.csv ../day1/digits/validationsample.csv
472 correct, 28 wrong = 94.40%
```

Where the `trainingsample.csv` and `validationsample.csv` are files given out
in the course.
